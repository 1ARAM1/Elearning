                    <p>We use "some" for positive sentences, "any" for questions and negative sentences, and "no" for total negation.</p>

                    <p>Use "much" with uncountable nouns and "many" with countable nouns. "A lot of" works for both. "Few" and "little" refer to small amounts, but "few" is for countable nouns and "little" is for uncountable nouns.</p>
